### AI research portfolios
<br>

**◉Linguistic research of Japanese Joshi words (日本語の助詞と英語の前置詞の役割の比較)**<br>
In this research, I checked how Japanese Joshi is working in linguistic roles. To compare how is it important to the English words, I researched the frequencies of Japanese Joshi and English prepositions.<br>

**◉Comparing the results by changing the hyper-parameters.(パラメータを変更したときの結果への影響の計測)**<br>
The y-value is the strength of concrete, and the dataset is each volumes of construction materials and age of concrete. And analyze the y-hat values by comparing the varieties of hyper parameters using regression model and mean_squared_error value.<br>

**◉The final assignemnt of IBM AI Engineering Professional(IBM認定AI Engineering Professionalの最終課題)**<br>
Classify the concrete cracks using photo image of concretes and PyTorch.<br>

<br><br><br>

**◉Recognition system of Facial Expression(顔表情解析システム)**<br>
The total system of facial expression recognition packages through the video and APIs. You can recognize in both real time and later because this package includes server side programmes for both pattern.<br>

**◉Evaluation of whether the fines of violation will be paid(Michigan Univ. Assignment)(罰則金支払い確率予測<ミシガン大学課題>)**<br>
This assignment of university of Michigan is very well organized and using Random Forest Classifier.<br>
