**◉research question**<br>
I always have thought Japanese Joshi is very unique and frequencies are top level in Japanese and I am interested in how different with English prepositions.<br>
In this report I'm examining "How word frequency are different and which has more significant role between English preposition and Japanese Joshi(postposition)?"<br>

**◉research question**<br>
* I will test how the results are changing by changing a series of model patterns using keras.<br>
* The dataset is the volumes of construction materials which is used to compose concrete, such as cement and water.<br>
* The strength of concrete is the target value, and I will predict and research the y-hat value by regression model and mean_squared_error value.<br>
* This dataset also includes age of concrete mix even though age is important value for strength.<br>
