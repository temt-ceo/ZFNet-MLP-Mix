# ZFNet-MLP-Mix
ZFNet-MLP Mix ML Project

This Homepage is organized for the purpose of aggregating the results of Kaggle Research. Each portfolios of AI research can be seen in following link.

### Kaggle web sites
**◉the region and the domain category**<br>
**Japan and Linguistics**<br><br>
**◉research question**<br>
I always have thought Japanese Joshi is very unique and frequencies are top level in Japanese and I am interested in how different with English prepositions.<br>
In this report I'm examining "How word frequency are different and which has more significant role between English preposition and Japanese Joshi(postposition)?"<br>

**◉the region and the domain category**<br>
**USA, construction materials**<br><br>
**◉research question**<br>
・ I tested how the results are changing by changing a series of model patterns using keras.<br>
・ The dataset is the volumes of construction materials which is used to concrete composition such as cement and water.<br>
・ The strength of concrete is the target value, and I predicted and researched the y-hat value by regression model and mean_squared_error value.<br>
・ This dataset also includes age of concrete mix even though age is important value for strength.<br>

**◉the region and the domain category**<br>
**USA, CONCRETE STRUCTURE IMAGES**<br><br>
**◉research question**<br>
**How to classify concrete crack using PyTorch and concrete crack images**<br>
・ I have numerous images which are taken at lots of concrete structure sites.<br>
・ Those images are devided into Positive(include crack) and Negative folders.<br>
・ I must create a model to classify the picture is including crack or not.<br>
**これはIBM認定AI Engineering Professionalの最終課題、127x127x3の画像をPyTorchを使って解析する、**<br>
**を無料環境では最も早いkaggle上で解析したものです。Modelは全て手作りです。**<br>

### Hands On
**(1)[Facial Expression Recognition](Hands-On-Facial-Expression-Recognition.ipynb): Read the video and recognize the face in real time and display the white box on the human face and recognize and show those facial expressions<br>ビデオを読み込み、顔を検出、正方形の枠出し及び感情をリアルタイムに枠上にテキスト化、ブラウザ上に表示する**<br>
**(2)[Network Community Analysis](Hands-On-Community-Model-Analysis.ipynb): Using networkx analyze network nodes inside a company over the e-mails, train the model to predict node attributes such as salary, and check the model**<br>
