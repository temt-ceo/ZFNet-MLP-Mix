**◉the region and the domain category**<br>
**Japan and Linguistics**<br><br>
**◉research question**<br>
I always have thought Japanese Joshi is very unique and frequencies are top level in Japanese and I am interested in how different with English prepositions.<br>
In this report I'm examining "How word frequency are different and which has more significant role between English preposition and Japanese Joshi(postposition)?"<br>

**◉the region and the domain category**<br>
**USA, construction materials**<br><br>
**◉research question**<br>
・ I will test how the results are changing by changing a series of model patterns using keras.<br>
・ The dataset is the volumes of construction materials which is used to compose concrete, such as cement and water.<br>
・ The strength of concrete is the target value, and I will predict and research the y-hat value by regression model and mean_squared_error value.<br>
・ This dataset also includes age of concrete mix even though age is important value for strength.<br>

**◉the region and the domain category**<br>
**USA, CONCRETE STRUCTURE IMAGES**<br><br>
**◉research question**<br>
**How to classify concrete crack using PyTorch and concrete crack images**<br>
・ I have numerous images which are taken at lots of concrete structure sites.<br>
・ Those images are devided into Positive(include crack) and Negative folders.<br>
・ I must create a model to classify the picture is including crack or not.<br>
