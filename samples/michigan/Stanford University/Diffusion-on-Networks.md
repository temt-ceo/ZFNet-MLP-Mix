# Diffusion(拡散) on Networks
 - E[d] -- Expected Degreeの意味.(公式の"d"と置き換えられる)
 - nonzero steady state -- sustainableなinfectionがある状態（λ>0）
 - low density no condition (degreeが少ないと感染は少ない)
 - θ: あなたがランダムに会う人が感染している確率(0~1,0:感染無し)。これが一定値あることをsteady state.
# Networks and Behavior
```
How does networs structure impact behavior?
 - diffusion .. simple infections, contagion
 - learning .. opinions, information
 - games on networks .. choices, decisions

Diffusion(拡散)
 - disease
 - ideas basic information
 - buy a product or not

S-Shape Spatial Pattern
 - 他の人が特定の作業をしていた人数が多いほど、その作業を行うまでの期間が短いなど（アドバイスなどで拡散した）
 - 農産物(交配種)など他の人が耕作している人が多いほど影響受ける。
x軸： 時間（特定の時間軸で実行する割合が増える。その早い遅いは環境の影響を受ける）
```
# Bass Model
```
Bass Model .. 予測によく使われる。 
 - A benchmark model with no explicit social structure
 - F(t): fraction of the population who have adopted action 1 at time t
 - p: rate of spontaneous  innovation/adoption .. 自発的に行う（最初のdF(t)/d(t)の傾き）
 - q: rate of imitation of adoption .. 真似をする(大きいとS-shapeに)
 式: dF(t)/dt = (p + q*F(t))(1-F(t))    1-F(t) .. まだadoptしていない(action=0)人達
 - "いつ"拡散(diffusion)し、"どれくらいになる"かはこの式では求められない
```
# Diffusion on Random Networks
```
Richer Model(より複雑なModel)を紹介
 - Idea, disease, computer virus spreads via connections in the network
 - Nodes are linked if one would "infect" the other (fluのように)
 - Work with Erdos-Renyi random network
 - ネットワークのコンポーネントが大きいほど感染は多い。
 - Size of the giant component when .. 1/n < p < log(n)/n (大きなコンポーネントができる条件。最低はcircleができ初める条件)
```
# Giant Component Poisson Case
```
Calculating the Size of the Giant Component(1度だけ感染する前提)
 - q: fraction of nodes in largest component
 - 1 - q: probability that a node is outside of the giant component
 - 1 - q = Σ(1-q)^d * P(d)
 - P(d): the chance that the node has d neighbors (d=degree)
 コンポーネントの拡大には生成されるdegreeが鍵を握っている。（最初は全てindividualな状態）
Solve for q..
 Solve 1 - q = Σ(1-q)^d * P(d)  .. E(d)により感染の大きさカーブが形成される。
```
# SIS Model
```
Susceptible(感受性が強い) Infective Susceptible (繰り返すことを意味している。)
 - get well randomely in any period at rate δ > 0
 - Let p be the percent infected
 - number of infected neighbors with rate v > 0, plus spontaneous ε
 Bass Modelに回復者をプラスしたような式
 - p = 1 - δ/v (但し、p>=0)(δ < v で感染者は増える。)
 - p(d): fraction of nodes of degree d infected = fraction of nodes that have d meetings

The fraction of the population with degree d that is infected in steady state is
ρ(d) = λθd/(λθd+1), where λ = υ/δ:
・ υ is the infection rate (at which uninfected node gets infected by an infected neighbor);
・ δ is the recovery rate (at which infected node recovers from infection);
・ θ is the fraction of randomly chosen neighbors who are infected.

# Solving the SIS Model

あなたが歩いて会う人の内感染している人の割合 θ = H(θ) = ΣP(d)λθd^2/[(λθd+1)*E[d]]
How H(θ) depends on P(d), E[d] etc.

nonzero steady stateをネットワークが持つためには -- υ/δ(=λ) > E[d]/E[d^2]
　上記を満たす為に通常のネットワークで必要なのは -- υ/δ(=λ) > 1/E[d] (=> E[d]==E[d^2])
　上記を満たす為にE-Rネットワークで必要なのは -- υ/δ(=λ) > 1/(1+E[d])
　上記を満たす為にpower-lowネットワークで必要なのは -- E[d^2] diverges(always have a nonzero steady state)(=> λ>0)

θ = Σ P(d)*λθ*d^2 / ((λθ*d + 1) * E[d])

# EXERCISE

【Diffusion】
Regarding the "S-shaped adoption" pattern described in this video lecture from the data of Griliches(1957)
on hybrid corn diffusion, which of the following statements are correct?
a) The adoption rate kept accelerating until all farmers had adopted.
b) The adoption accelerated after some point of time in each of the states pictured in the graph.
c) This "S-shaped" adoption pattern is a very rare occurrence only observed in hybrid corn diffusion.
d) The adoption process started out slowly in each of the states pictured in the graph.
-> b, d (S-shapedの特徴)

【Bass Model】
The version of the Bass Model described here contains the following factors:
p: the rate of spontaneous adoption;
q: the rate of imitation;
F(t): the fraction who have adopted by time t.
Which of the following statements are correct regarding how the "S-shape" is generated by the model?
a) The acceleration part of the "S-shaped" adoption curve is generated by having p grow with time and
   q shrink with time.
b) The only way for this model to generate the acceleration part of the "S-shaped" adoption curve is to have a very tiny q.
c) The acceleration in adoption is generated by a q that is larger than p.
d) The adoption rate eventually slows down in this model because the population that hasn't adopted yet becomes small.

【Diffusion on Random Networks】
To study diffusion in the context of Erdos-Renyi random networks, we are exploring the size of the giant component
for values of p such that 1/n < p < log(n)/n. Since then there are some emerging components to analyze
and yet the network is unlikely to be connected.
Which of the following approximates this region of p for n = 50 nodes?
[Hint: log(50) is approximately 3.9.]
-> 1/50 < p < 3.9/50 => 0.02 < p < 0.078 -> p 非含有 (0.02, 0.078)

【Giant Component Poisson Case】
Recall that an approximation for the probability q that a node is in the giant component, as described in this lecture,
is the solution of the equation 1-q=Σ(1-q)^d * P(d)
Suppose the degree distribution is such that d = 0 has probability 1/3 and d=2 has probability 2/3,
so that P(0)=1/3, P(2)=2/3. Also, take (1-q)^0 = 1.
The (nonzero) probability q that a node is in the giant component is then a solution to which of the following equations?
-> P(0): 1-q = Σ(1-q)^d * P(d) = 1*1/3
   P(2): 1-q = Σ(1-q)^d * P(d) = (1-q)^2*2/3
   P(d): 1-q = 1/3 + 2/3 * (1-q)^2

【SIS Model】
Following a mean-field approximation of the SIS model, the fraction of the population
with degree d that is infected in steady state is ρ(d) = λθd/(λθd+1), where λ = υ/δ, and recall that:
・ υ is the infection rate (at which uninfected node gets infected by an infected neighbor);
・ δ is the recovery rate (at which infected node recovers from infection);
・ θ is the fraction of randomly chosen neighbors who are infected.
Which of the following statement(s) are correct in a case where θ and λ are positive?
[Hint: if your calculus(公式) is rusty, simply examine this expression for d at 0 and d very large.]
a) The steady state infection fraction ρ(d) increased in d.
b) The steady state infection fraction ρ(d) approaches 0 as d becomes very large.
c) The steady state infection fraction ρ(d) does not depend on the value of d.
d) The steady state infection fraction ρ(d) decreases in d.
-> a

【Solving the SIS Model】
According to the "Theorem: Conditions for Steady State of Mean-Field SIS Process" covered in this lecture:
If the parameters are such that υ=0.2, δ=0.2, E[d]=3 and E[d^2]=5,
does there exist a nonzero steady-state of θ?
a) Yes
b) No
-> a (Notice υ/δ(=λ) = 1 > E[d]/E[d^2] = 0.6)

【Solving the SIS Model】
Consider three degree distributions, each of them places equal liklihood on a three different degrees.
・ P1(d) is such that degrees are in {1,3,5}, each has probability 1/3;
・ P2(d) is such that degrees are in {2,3,4}, each has probability 1/3;
・ P3(d) is such that degrees are in {1,2,3}, each has probability 1/3;
Compare the corresponding (nonzero) steady-state rates of infected neighbors: θ1, θ2 and θ3:
According to our discussions on "Ordering Networks" in this lecture, which of the following comparisons are correct?
a) θ１ < θ3
b) θ2 < θ3
c) θ2 > θ3
d) θ１ > θ2
-> c, d (θ1>θ2 because P1 is a mean-preserving spread of P2(凹の上を直線で引っ張った状態). θ2>θ3 because P2 First-Order Stochastically Dominates P3.)
