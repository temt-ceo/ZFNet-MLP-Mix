# Networks and Behavior
```
How does networs structure impact behavior?
 - diffusion .. simple infections, contagion
 - learning .. opinions, information
 - games on networks .. choices, decisions

Diffusion(拡散)
 - disease
 - ideas basic information
 - buy a product or not

S-Shape Spatial Pattern
 - 他の人が特定の作業をしていた人数が多いほど、その作業を行うまでの期間が短いなど（アドバイスなどで拡散した）
 - 農産物(交配種)など他の人が耕作している人が多いほど影響受ける。
x軸： 時間（特定の時間軸で実行する割合が増える。その早い遅いは環境の影響を受ける）
```
# Bass Model
```
Bass Model .. 予測によく使われる。 
 - A benchmark model with no explicit social structure
 - F(t): fraction of the population who have adopted action 1 at time t
 - p: rate of spontaneous  innovation/adoption .. 自発的に行う（最初のdF(t)/d(t)の傾き）
 - q: rate of imitation of adoption .. 真似をする(大きいとS-shapeに)
 式: dF(t)/dt = (p + q*F(t))(1-F(t))    1-F(t) .. まだadoptしていない(action=0)人達
 - "いつ"拡散(diffusion)し、"どれくらいになる"かはこの式では求められない
```
# Diffusion on Random Networks
```
Richer Model(より複雑なModel)を紹介
 - Idea, disease, computer virus spreads via connections in the network
 - Nodes are linked if one would "infect" the other (fluのように)
 - Work with Erdos-Renyi random network
 - ネットワークのコンポーネントが大きいほど感染は多い。
 - Size of the giant component when .. 1/n < p < log(n)/n (大きなコンポーネントができる条件。最低はcircleができ初める条件)

# EXERCISE

【Diffusion】
Regarding the "S-shaped adoption" pattern described in this video lecture from the data of Griliches(1957)
on hybrid corn diffusion, which of the following statements are correct?
a) The adoption rate kept accelerating until all farmers had adopted.
b) The adoption accelerated after some point of time in each of the states pictured in the graph.
c) This "S-shaped" adoption pattern is a very rare occurrence only observed in hybrid corn diffusion.
d) The adoption process started out slowly in each of the states pictured in the graph.
-> b, d (S-shapedの特徴)

【Bass Model】
The version of the Bass Model described here contains the following factors:
p: the rate of spontaneous adoption;
q: the rate of imitation;
F(t): the fraction who have adopted by time t.
Which of the following statements are correct regarding how the "S-shape" is generated by the model?
a) The acceleration part of the "S-shaped" adoption curve is generated by having p grow with time and
   q shrink with time.
b) The only way for this model to generate the acceleration part of the "S-shaped" adoption curve is to have a very tiny q.
c) The acceleration in adoption is generated by a q that is larger than p.
d) The adoption rate eventually slows down in this model because the population that hasn't adopted yet becomes small.

【Diffusion on Random Networks】
To study diffusion in the context of Erdos-Renyi random networks, we are exploring the size of the giant component
for values of p such that 1/n < p < log(n)/n. Since then there are some emerging components to analyze
and yet the network is unlikely to be connected.
Which of the following approximates this region of p for n = 50 nodes?
[Hint: log(50) is approximately 3.9.]
-> 1/50 < p < 3.9/50 => 0.02 < p < 0.078 -> p 非含有 (0.02, 0.078)
