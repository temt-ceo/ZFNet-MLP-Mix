# Social and Economic Networks: Online <br>　　Professor Matthew O. Jackson<br> 　　　　Stanford University

## Overview
```
  Social networks pervade our social and economic lives. They play a central role in the 
transmission of information about job oppertunities and are critical to the trade of many
goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which
languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals,
how much education we obtain, and out likelihood of succeeding professionally. The countless
ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how
social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in
a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do. This course provides an overview and 
synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists,
economists, computer scientists, physcists, and mathmaticians.
  The course begines with some empirical background on social and economic networks,
and an overview of concepts used to describe and measure networks. Next, we will cover a
set of models of how networks form, including random network models as well as strategic
formation models, and some hybrids. We will then discuss a series of models of how networks
impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.
```
## Requirements/Prerequisites
```
  The course is aimed at people interested in researching social and economic networks,
but should be accessible to advanced undergraduates and other people who have some pre-
requisites in mathmatics and statistics. For example, it will be assumed that students are
comfortable with basic concepts from linear algebra, probability theory, and statistics,
and some light calculus. Beyond those concepts, the course will be self-contained.
```
## Data and Other Resources.
```
  Some of the problem sets ask you to work with network analysis programs and to analyze
data. You can find links to the data and instructions for the netwoek analysis programs
embedded in the problem sets, and also posted separately under the Resources tab.
  
  Much of the material for the course is covered with added detail and references in a text:

## Final Exam.

  There is a final exam to help you pull together everything that you have learned.

## Summary - Games On Networks -
```
＊ ネットワーク分析上の推定
 - Strategic Complements and Substitutes exhibit very different patterns
 
 - Position Matters:
   - more connected take
     - higher actions in complements (and easier) (e.g.友人が本を持っていたら自分も買うという行動)
     - lower actions in substitutes (e.g.友人が本を持っていたら借りられるので本を買わないという行動)
 
 - Structure matters:
   - some networks lead to diffusion of behavior others do not
   - Homophily(モフィリィ:似た性質同士は集まりやすい)/cohesion is a critical determinant of diversity of actions
